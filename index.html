<div class="note">Many of these Rust crates do only handle raw bytes and are fully compatible with your own data types or CRDTs. If you don't care about that and just want features, we have you covered as well!</div>
<ul class="libraries">
  <li>
    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/p2panda-net" target="_blank"><code>📦 p2panda-net</code></a> Find peers in a peer-to-peer network, connect to them directly - whereever they are - and exchange any data of your interest in form of byte streams.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/p2panda-discovery" target="_blank"><code>📦 p2panda-discovery</code></a> Solutions to find other peers in your local network or on the internet and interfaces to start building your own.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/p2panda-sync" target="_blank"><code>📦 p2panda-sync</code></a> Protocol implementations to efficiently "catch up on past state" with other peers and interfaces to start building your own.

  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/p2panda-store" target="_blank"><code>📦 p2panda-store</code></a> Interfaces and implementations to store p2panda data types in databases, memory or file-systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/p2panda-stream" target="_blank"><code>📦 p2panda-stream</code></a> Collection of various methods to process your p2panda data streams before they reach your application.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>🚧 p2panda-node</code> All-in-one p2panda node which can be used in federated or fully decentralised networks or both at the same time. Supports "lightweight" clients running in the browser.

  <li>
    <code>🚧 p2panda-caps</code> Manage access to data with capabilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>🚧 p2panda-groups</code> Local-first roles and group-encryption with Post-Compromise-Security and optional Forward-Secrecy.
