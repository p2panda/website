<h2 id="about"><a href="#about">About</a></h2>
<p>p2panda aims to provide everything you need to build <strong>modern,
    privacy-respecting and secure local-first applications.</strong></p>
<p>We have adopted a <strong>modular approach</strong>—allowing projects
the freedom to pick what they need and integrate it with minimal friction.
We believe this approach contributes the most to a wider, interoperable p2p
ecosystem which outlives “framework lock-in”.</p>
<p>Many of our Rust crates operate over raw bytes and are <strong>fully
    compatible with your own data types and any CRDT</strong>. In case you
don't plan on building your own peer-to-peer protocol, we have you covered
with <strong>all features required to build a mobile or desktop
    application</strong>.</p>
<p>We're using <strong>existing libraries</strong> like <a
    href="https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh" target="_blank">iroh</a> and
well-established standards such as BLAKE3, Ed25519, STUN, CBOR, TLS, QUIC,
<a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec" target="_blank">UCAN</a>, <a
href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm"
target="_blank">Double Ratchet</a> and more - as long as they give us the
radical offline-first guarantee we need.</p>
<p>We want collaboration, encryption and access-control to work even when
operating over unstable or ephemeral connections. Towards this end, we're
<strong>actively working alongside researchers to design and implement
    resilient solutions</strong>.</p>
<p>p2panda is "broadcast-only" at it’s heart, making any data not only
offline-first but also <strong>compatible with post-internet communication
    infrastructure</strong>, such as shortwave, packet radio, Bluetooth Low
Energy, LoRa or simply a USB stick.</p>
<p>p2panda is a very <strong>multifaceted project</strong>: We maintain our crates, apply
for grants, design protocols and do research in radically distributed
data-types. We organise community events and write peer-to-peer
applications with our friends and collaborators.</p>
