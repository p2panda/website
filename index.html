<div class="note">Many of these Rust crates do only handle raw bytes and are fully compatible with your own data types or CRDTs. If you don't care about that and just want features, we have you covered as well!</div>
<ul class="libraries">
  <li>
    <a href="#"><code>p2panda-net</code></a> Find peers in a peer-to-peer network, connect to them directly - whereever they are - and exchange any data of your interest in form of byte streams.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#"><code>p2panda-discovery</code></a> Solutions to find other peers in your local network or on the internet and interfaces to start building your own.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#"><code>p2panda-sync</code></a> Protocol implementations to efficiently "catch up on past state" with other peers and interfaces to start building your own.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#"><code>p2panda-blobs</code></a> Everything a panda needs to fullfill panda needs, like it's deeds to do the panda bamboo!
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#"><code>p2panda-core</code></a> Highly extensible data-types of the p2panda protocol for secure, distributed and efficient exchange of data, supporting networks from the internet to packet radio, LoRa or BLE.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#"><code>p2panda-store</code></a> Interfaces and implementations to store p2panda data types in databases, memory or file-systems.</li>
  <li>
    <a href="#"><code>p2panda-stream</code></a> Collection of various methods to process your p2panda data streams before they reach your application.</li>
